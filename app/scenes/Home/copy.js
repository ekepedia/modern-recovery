        quotes: [
            "“I used alcohol as a lubricant for my social anxiety. After college, drinking progressively became a part of every aspect of my life. Eventually it became something I was doing nearly every night, alone in my room, as a reward for making it through the day and an attempt to drown out my own reality.” - Nicole P, Tempest Member 2019",
            "“I drank till I didn't feel. I blacked out often and had sex with new people most evenings. Throwing up was normal. Panic attacks were normal.” - Valentine, Tempest Member Winter 2019",
            "“I started binge drinking at age 16 . I was a daily drinker through most of my late teens to mid 20s before I became more of a stay-at-home ‘shame pit’ drinker. I still drank nearly every day  but my main goal was to keep that hidden from everyone around me.” - Lisa, Tempest Member, Winter 2018\n",
            "“I never really thought about my alcohol consumption. It was like coffee—just something that you have around that helps you feel better and get stuff done.” - Alex, Tempest Member 2020\n",
            "“Throughout most of my life, starting at highschool football games, college dorm rooms, and all the way through early days in the workforce, drinking was just something we always did. It was always around—participating didn’t occur as a choice, but more an assumption.” - Abby, Tempest 2018"

            "“My drinking was social at first, then when I noticed I was drinking much more than my friends, I started pre-outing drinking, then added in post-outing drinking. -Tina, Tempest Member 2018",
            "“I recall having a nagging feeling that I was too dependent on alcohol but could not envision getting through my days without my daily wine habit. At the time I was caught in the middle of a major family breakdown and thought alcohol was my only ally.” - Amy C, Tempest Member 2019\n",
            "“I remember being incredibly cognizant of the fact that everyone else seemed to be enjoying themselves while I frantically schemed how to get as much booze as possible before the bottle ran out.” - Lisa, Tempest Member, Winter 2018\n",
            "“The moment I knew that I had to do something about my drinking, although it was a while before I actually did anything about it, was when I snuck tequila into the office, left work early, and took a cab home. It was a Tuesday.” - Irina, Tempest Member 2019 \n",
            "“I didn’t have any concrete evidence, it was more just this pervasive feeling of unease about my drinking.” -Alex, Tempest Member 2020\n",
            "“I remember sitting in a cozy booth with my best friends. Rather than feeling full and good, I was counting the drinks on the table calculating the cost, ‘chatting’ about our normal updates but feeling oddly disconnected to my people and out of my body. Nothing was wrong, so why was I so in my head? But I knew something wasn’t working for me. I quickly covered up the feeling from myself—this was about a year before I started to change my relationship to alcohol.”  - Abby, Tempest 2018\n",

I knew I was limiting my potential, and my addiction was getting in the way.” - Nicole P, Tempest Member 2019\n",
            "“One night out, I saw a lady my age guzzling beer one after another, and it hit me that I did that with wine at home. Out at a bar, I'd drink ‘respectably’ slower, then go home and guzzle. Seeing her that night, I saw myself and thought,  ‘Yuck, this isn't pretty.’” - Tina, Tempest Member 2018\n",

            "“I wanted to remember kissing my kids goodnight. I wanted to breathe on them and have them nuzzle their faces in my neck without worrying how I smelled. I wanted to BE in those moments and not mentally half there because I wanted back to my beverage.” - Syd, Tempest Member 2018\n",
            "“I watched myself show up everywhere armored with liquids. Some traveled in bladders hidden by cardboard boxes and others in giant glass bottles. And although this was nothing new, it was my fierce protection, and the tie I felt to booze had me wondering. \n",
            "“One day I asked myself, ‘What do I actually want my life to look like? What’s getting in the way of that?’” - Alex, Tempest Member 2020\n",

            "“I knew I'd quit when I turned 40, until that day came and I couldn't. I spent the next 10 years devising plans to quit or moderate, until I gave that up and started hiding it. At 52, laying on the bathroom floor crying, I googled recovery methods other than AA and found Holly and Tempest.\" - Tina, Tempest Member 2018\n",
            "“There was the time my husband suggested I skip another glass of wine at a family party, the time I spilled my wine all over my son in Spain, and the time I fell flat on my face while entertaining friends. However, the final straw was losing our 20-year-old daughter and self medicating through the grief.” -Amy, Tempest Member 2019\n",
            "“A terrible hangover after a family party and a two-hour long car ride home trying not to puke was my moment of reckoning. It was the last time I was so sick I thought I might die. It would take me seven months more to quit, but it served as the catalyst for me to start exploring options.” - Lisa, Tempest Member 2018\n",

I didn't want to continue to ruin all of my connections, friendships, and relationships. And I was just so tired of hating myself.  - DL\n",
            "“The biggest consequence of my drinking was the estrangement from my three adult children.

Landed a rewarding job. Now I'm finding there's more growth beyond what I imagined and I have the support to keep going.” - Valentine, Tempest Member 2019\n",
            "“Failure, success, ten days alcohol-free, ten months alcohol-free, failure, rebuilding, retooling, focusing on the life I want and what it could be if I can kick it to the curb. Envisioning a better way, photos of people I admire who have been through this and won. Mantras. Reflection. Hobbies. Puzzles. Workouts. Success.” - Tina, Tempest Member 2018\n",
            "“One of my favorite quotes is, ‘The opposite of addiction is not sobriety, it's connection.’ I've read plenty of books and listened to hundreds of podcasts, but the most essential tool has been the friendships I've made with other sober women. We hold each other up and keep each other accountable.” - Nicole P, Tempest Member 2019",
            "“I had a million ‘day ones’. I finally came into my first Tempest program with 90 days of white-knuckling under my belt. I needed support and tools and didn't know how to start. I was so disconnected from myself that my process has been a long journey home to who I was before the alcohol took over.” - Lisa, Tempest Member, Winter 2018",
